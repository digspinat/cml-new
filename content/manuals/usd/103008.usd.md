    reviewItemDescr: Very good book comes in handy since Im not a mechanic I've learned a ton about this car and how its functioning. The added pictures help to visualize what your reading about and make sense out of it. Would definelty recommend it to any Mercedes ML  owner who wants to get to know their vehicle and do some of the work on it themselves.
