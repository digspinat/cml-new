    reviewItemDescr: 'For how much this manual costs you would think it would be more complete...I found myself on a couple occasions looking for specifications and/or how to repair or replace a part but found nothing in the book on how to do it. It''s good enough for most repairs, but for the cost I wish it was more detailed and covered everything that is on this car.'

      I am by no means a mechanic. Using this book I have replaced my head gasket, heater core, brakes, and much more soon to come. This book is the greatest thing ever for e60 BMWs, and is leaps and bounds above the Chilton manuals. If you are on the fence, BUY IT. It will save you hundreds of dollars down the road and make you feel like you know a lot more than you do.

      Best $40 spent on this car yet.
